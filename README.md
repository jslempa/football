# Football Stock Exchange

This project is an attempt to build an app where users buy and sell shares of NFL players in a simulated stock market. 

## User Stories
As a user, I want to be able to:
- Search for players
- Purchase shares of players I am interested in
- Sell shares of players I no longer want
- Add players to a watchlist so I can monitor price changes
- Remove players from my watchlist when I am no longer interested
- Deposit and withdraw funds
